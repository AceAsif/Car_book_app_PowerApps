# Car_book_app_PowerApps
- It is a simple car booking app. 
- It allows user to book a car for a specific date range and shows a list of available cars. After the car the is booked, the car is unable for that specific date range.
- It also stops the user from selecting a date that is not the current day. 
- It has a check for checking if the start date and the end date is blank.
- It stops the user from selecting an end date older than the start date.
- This is my first PowerApps project.
- I used an excel table called 'CarList' and Onedrive for business as the data source of the app. I have included the excel file here.
